# PeeringDB

These producers create / produce data to two topics:
1. `ihr_peeringdb_ix` for IX information like name, country, and, most important, peering LAN prefixes.
2. `ihr_peeringdb_netixlan` for IX members and their router IPs.

## Requirements

- [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) to fetch data from PeeringDB.
- [confluent_kafka](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python) to connect to Kafka.
- [msgpack](https://pypi.org/project/msgpack/) to compress messages of the Kafka topics.
- A Kafka server behind one of: `kafka1,kafka2,kafka4,kafka4`.

Install Python dependencies via
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Just execute the scripts, there are no parameters. Logs are written to `ihr-kafka{ix,netixlan}.log`.

```bash
python3 ix.py
python3 netixlan.py
```

## About PeeringDB Data

Below is an ER diagram that contains only the fields that are used and/or pushed to the Kafka topics.
The `ix.py` producer combines information from the `ix`,`ixlan`, and `ixpfx` tables, whereas
`netixlan.py` only uses data from `netixlan`.

We mainly care about two properties:
1. The peering LAN(s) of an IX
2. The IPs of the border routers owned by IX members

The actual prefix of a peering LAN is the `prefix` property of the `ixpfx` table. To map the prefix
to the IX, we need to connect via the `ixlan` table that otherwise contains only information we are
not interested in.

Since we store the IX information like name and country in the `ix` topic, we do not make the
connection again when fetching the `netixlan` table. The relationship is only included in the
diagram for clarity.

**NOTES**
- An IX can have more than one peering LAN.
- An IX member can have multiple `netixlan` entries for the same IX, i.e., `(ix_id, asn)` is not
unique. Furthermore, one or both of `ipaddr4` and `ipaddr6` can be set.
